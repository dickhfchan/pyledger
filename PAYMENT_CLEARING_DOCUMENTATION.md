## üîß Usage Examples

### Python API Usage

#### 1. Single Invoice Payment Clearing
```python
from pyledger.payment_clearing import PaymentClearingManager

manager = PaymentClearingManager()

# Clear payment for a single invoice
result = manager.clear_single_invoice_payment(
    invoice_number='INV-2024-001',
    payment_amount=3000.0,
    payment_date='2024-02-20',
    payment_reference='PAY-001',
    clearing_method='partial'
)

print(f"Payment cleared: ${result['payment_amount']:.2f}")
print(f"Remaining balance: ${result['remaining_balance']:.2f}")
```

#### 2. Multiple Invoice Payment Clearing
```python
# Clear multiple invoices with proportional allocation
result = manager.clear_multiple_invoices_payment(
    invoice_numbers=['INV-2024-002', 'INV-2024-003'],
    total_payment_amount=5000.0,
    payment_date='2024-02-25',
    payment_reference='PAY-002',
    allocation_method='proportional'
)

print(f"Invoices cleared: {result['invoices_cleared']}")
for allocation in result['allocations']:
    print(f"  {allocation['invoice_number']}: ${allocation['amount']:.2f}")
```

#### 3. Aging Report Generation
```python
# Generate aging report for receivables
aging_report = manager.generate_aging_report(
    report_date='2024-03-01',
    schedule_type='receivable'
)

print(f"Total outstanding: ${aging_report['total_amount']:.2f}")
for period, data in aging_report['aging_summary'].items():
    if data['count'] > 0:
        print(f"  {period}: {data['count']} items, ${data['amount']:.2f}")
```

#### 4. Payment Summary
```python
# Get payment summary for a date range
summary = manager.get_payment_summary(
    payment_type='receivable',
    start_date='2024-02-01',
    end_date='2024-03-01'
)

print(f"Total payments: {summary['total_payments']}")
print(f"Total cleared: ${summary['total_cleared']:.2f}")
print(f"Average payment: ${summary['avg_payment']:.2f}")
```

#### 5. Outstanding Items
```python
# Get outstanding invoices
outstanding_invoices = manager.get_outstanding_invoices()

for invoice in outstanding_invoices:
    print(f"Invoice {invoice['invoice_number']}: "
          f"${invoice['outstanding_amount']:.2f} "
          f"({invoice['days_overdue']} days overdue)")

# Get customer-specific outstanding invoices
acme_invoices = manager.get_outstanding_invoices('Acme Corp')
```

## üìä Allocation Methods

### 1. Proportional Allocation
- Allocates payment proportionally based on outstanding amounts
- Ensures fair distribution across multiple invoices
- Formula: `allocation = (outstanding_amount / total_outstanding) * payment_amount`

### 2. Oldest First Allocation
- Prioritizes invoices by issue date (oldest first)
- Useful for managing cash flow and reducing aging
- Clears oldest invoices completely before moving to newer ones

### 3. Largest First Allocation
- Prioritizes invoices by outstanding amount (largest first)
- Useful for reducing high-value outstanding amounts
- Clears largest invoices first

## üîç Reporting Features
